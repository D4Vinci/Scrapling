I've been working on Scrapling and other public projects in my spare time and have invested considerable resources and effort to make them available to the community for free. By becoming a sponsor, you would directly fund my coffee reserves, helping me continuously update existing projects and create new ones.

You can sponsor me directly through the [GitHub Sponsors program](https://github.com/sponsors/D4Vinci) or [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/d4vinci).

Thank you, stay curious, and hack the planet! ❤️
